title: "Undergrad Senior Seminar Poster on LSTM Recurrent Neural Network"
date: 2017-04-23
---
<p>This is a poster on artificial neural networks I created for my undergraduate senior seminar class, based on the <a href="http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/">work</a> of Daniel Johnson. I trained the model to compose classical piano music based on the works of around 30 different classical composers of different genres and era. I will be posting some of the music composed by the network in the near future. The individual images in the poster can be found at my <a href="http://github.com/bhattarabi/senior_seminar_posters/">repository</a>. They're all saved as XML files which can be opened using <a href="http://draw.io">draw</a>.</p>
